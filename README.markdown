Some Wi-Fi APs use Web Authentication, which is boring especially in mobile phones.

The program can make it easier.

1. Download the APK file and install it on your Android phone;
2. Run *MPI Wi-Fi*, enter your *Net ID* and *Password*;
3. Check the *Auto login* box;

Congratulation, the web login has gone.
